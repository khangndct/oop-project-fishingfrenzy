# Fish System Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## 🔄 Changes Made

### ✅ Replaced `FishData.gd` with Strategy Pattern Implementation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Added `FishBehaviorStrategy` with different behaviors for each rarity
- **Behavior Classes**: `CommonBehavior`, `UncommonBehavior`, `RareBehavior`, `EpicBehavior`, `LegendaryBehavior`
- **New Methods**: 
  - `get_effective_speed()` - combines base speed with behavior multiplier
  - `get_movement_pattern()` - returns movement style ("straight", "zigzag", "teleport", etc.)
  - `get_special_ability()` - returns special abilities ("dash", "invisibility", etc.)
  - `get_catch_difficulty()` - returns difficulty multiplier
  - `has_special_ability()` - boolean check for special abilities

### ✅ Replaced `FishFactory.gd` with Factory Method Pattern
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Different factories for different fish rarities
- **Factory Classes**: `BaseFishFactory`, `CommonFishFactory`, `RareFishFactory`, `LegendaryFishFactory`
- **Weighted Rarity System**: 
  - Common: 50% chance
  - Uncommon: 25% chance  
  - Rare: 15% chance
  - Epic: 8% chance
  - Legendary: 2% chance
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks spawned fish counts by rarity
- **Enhanced Behavior**: Different factories apply different behaviors

### ✅ Updated `Fish.gd` to Use New Methods
- Now uses `get_effective_speed()` instead of just `get_stat("speed")`
- Logs fish information including movement pattern and special abilities
- Fixed unused parameter warning in `_physics_process`

## 🎯 Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Strategy Pattern** (in FishData)
- Encapsulates different fish behaviors based on rarity
- Easy to add new behaviors without modifying existing code
- Runtime behavior switching based on fish rarity

### 2. **Factory Method Pattern** (in FishFactory)
- Creates appropriate fish factory based on rarity
- Template method for fish creation process
- Extensible for new fish types

### 3. **Template Method Pattern** (in BaseFishFactory)
- Defines skeleton of fish creation algorithm
- Subclasses override specific steps
- Consistent creation process across all factories

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved

### **Better Code Organization**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each class has a single responsibility
- Easy to understand and maintain

### **Improved Extensibility** 
- Easy to add new fish rarities
- Simple to add new behaviors
- Straightforward to create new factory types

### **Enhanced Gameplay**
- Rare fish actually feel rare (weighted spawning)
- Different behaviors for different rarities
- Special abilities for epic/legendary fish

### **Better Performance**
- Efficient object creation through factories
- No large conditional statements
- Optimized behavior delegation

## 🔍 Key Features

### **Weighted Rarity System**
```gdscript
# Legendary fish are now truly rare!
var weights = {
    FishData.Rarity.COMMON: 50,      # 50% chance
    FishData.Rarity.UNCOMMON: 25,    # 25% chance  
    FishData.Rarity.RARE: 15,        # 15% chance
    FishData.Rarity.EPIC: 8,         # 8% chance
    FishData.Rarity.LEGENDARY: 2     # 2% chance
}
```

### **Behavior-Based Speed**
```gdscript
# Fish now have direct speed values - no more double multiplication
func get_effective_speed() -> float:
    # Return the base speed directly
    return get_stat("speed")
```

### **Simplified Speed System**
```gdscript
# Rarity stats now have reasonable, direct speed values
var rarity_stats := {
    Rarity.COMMON: {
        "speed" = 50,     # Base speed for common fish
        "strength" = 5,
        "value" = 1,
    },
    Rarity.LEGENDARY: {
        "speed" = 110,    # Fast legendary fish
        "strength" = 25,
        "value" = 20,
    },
}
```

### **Special Abilities System**
```gdscript
# Different rarities have different abilities
class LegendaryBehavior:
    func get_special_ability() -> String:
        return "invisibility"
    
    func get_movement_pattern() -> String:
        return "teleport"
```

## 🧪 Testing the New System

The improved system is backward compatible but with enhanced features:
- All existing fish data resources will work
- Fish spawning now respects rarity weights
- Each fish displays its behavior information in console
- Statistics are tracked and can be accessed via `get_spawn_stats()`

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `Entities/Fish/FishData.gd` - Strategy Pattern implementation
- ✅ `Common/Utils/FishFactory.gd` - Factory Method Pattern implementation  
- ✅ `Entities/Fish/Fish.gd` - Updated to use new methods
- 🗑️ Removed temporary "Improved" files

## 🎮 Ready to Use!

The system is now ready to run with proper design patterns implemented. The factory will create fish with appropriate behaviors, and rare fish will actually be rare thanks to the weighted selection system!
