# Player Stats Menu & Fish-Based Progression System

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive Player Stats Menu system and the fish-based character progression mechanism implemented in the Fishing Frenzy game. The system provides players with detailed character information and implements a gradual strength progression based on caught fish.

## 🎯 Player Stats Menu

### Purpose
A centralized, in-game overlay that displays all player information, statistics, and active effects during gameplay without interrupting the fishing experience.

### Visual Design
- **Position**: Centered on screen (600x400 pixels)
- **Background**: Dark semi-transparent panel (90% opacity) with rounded corners
- **Layout**: Two-column design with clear visual hierarchy
- **Colors**: Strategic color coding for different information types

### Menu Structure

#### Left Panel - Player Information
1. **Player Picture**
   - Displays player sprite (100x100 pixels)
   - Loaded from `Assets/Img/Player/Player.svg`

2. **Base Stats Section** (Yellow header)
   - **Strength**: Base value + bonuses + progress percentage
   - **Speed**: Base value + bonuses + progress percentage
   - **Vitality**: Base value + bonuses + progress percentage
   - **Luck**: Base value + bonuses + progress percentage
   - Format: `"Strength: 4 (+1) (23.5%)"` where 23.5% is progress toward next level

3. **Energy Section** (Cyan header)
   - Current energy / Maximum energy
   - Energy cost per fish caught

4. **Money Display** (Gold color)
   - Current player money with $ symbol

#### Right Panel - Active Effects
1. **Active Buffs & Effects** (Yellow header)
   - **Fish Slow Potions**: 30%, 50%, or 70% effects (Cyan)
   - **Player Speed Potions**: 20%, 30%, or 40% boosts (Green)
   - **Rod Buff Potions**: 30%, 50%, or 70% enhancements (Orange)
   - **Legacy Potions**: Backward compatibility (Magenta)
   - Shows "No active buffs" when none are active (Gray)

### Controls & Interaction
- **Open**: Click "Player Stats" button (positioned next to Back button in HUD)
- **Close**: Click "Close" button or press ESC key
- **Integration**: Properly integrated into HUD CanvasLayer for correct UI layering

## 🐟 Fish-Based Strength Progression System

### Core Mechanism
Players gain fractional strength based on the strength value of fish they catch, creating a meaningful progression system tied directly to gameplay.

### Fish Strength Values by Rarity
- **Common**: 5 strength
- **Uncommon**: 10 strength
- **Rare**: 15 strength
- **Epic**: 20 strength
- **Legendary**: 25 strength

### Strength Gain Formula
**Formula**: `0.1% of Fish Strength`

**Gains per Fish Type**:
- **Common Fish**: +0.005 strength per catch
- **Uncommon Fish**: +0.01 strength per catch
- **Rare Fish**: +0.015 strength per catch
- **Epic Fish**: +0.02 strength per catch
- **Legendary Fish**: +0.025 strength per catch

### Progression Rates
**Fish Required for 1 Full Strength Point**:
- **100 Common Fish** = 1 strength point
- **100 Uncommon Fish** = 1 strength point
- **67 Rare Fish** = 1 strength point
- **50 Epic Fish** = 1 strength point
- **40 Legendary Fish** = 1 strength point

### Fractional Stat System
- **Accumulation**: Small gains accumulate as fractional values
- **Conversion**: When fractional stat reaches ≥1.0, converts to full stat point
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows percentage progress toward next level
- **Real-time Feedback**: Console messages show exact gains and progress

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `Rod.gd`
- Added `_gain_strength_from_fish(player, fish)` function
- Called automatically when fish is successfully caught
- Calculates and applies strength gain based on fish rarity

```gdscript
func _gain_strength_from_fish(player: Player, fish: Fish):
    var fish_strength = fish.fish_data.get_stat("strength")
    var strength_gain = fish_strength * 0.001  # 0.1% of fish strength
    player.add_fractional_strength(strength_gain)
```

#### 2. `Player.gd`
- Added fractional stat variables for all stats
- Implemented fractional stat functions with automatic conversion
- Added progress tracking methods
- Integrated with GlobalVariable for persistence

```gdscript
# Fractional stats for gradual progression
var fractional_strength : float = 0.0
var fractional_speed : float = 0.0
var fractional_vitality : float = 0.0
var fractional_luck : float = 0.0

func add_fractional_strength(amount: float):
    fractional_strength += amount
    while fractional_strength >= 1.0:
        strength += 1
        fractional_strength -= 1.0
```

#### 3. `GlobalVariable.gd`
- Added persistent storage for player base stats
- Added persistent storage for fractional progress
- Ensures stats persist across scenes and game sessions

```gdscript
# Player persistent stats
var player_strength : int = 1
var player_speed_stat : int = 1
var player_vitality : int = 1
var player_luck : int = 1

# Player fractional stats for gradual progression
var player_fractional_strength : float = 0.0
var player_fractional_speed : float = 0.0
var player_fractional_vitality : float = 0.0
var player_fractional_luck : float = 0.0
```

#### 4. `SaveManager.gd`
- Updated save data structure to include all player stats
- Added loading functionality for stat persistence
- Updated clear data function to reset progression

#### 5. `PlayerStatsMenu.gd`
- Enhanced to display fractional progress percentages
- Real-time stat updates when menu is opened
- Improved visual formatting with progress indicators

### Key Functions

#### Player Class
- `add_fractional_strength(amount: float)` - Adds fractional strength with auto-conversion
- `get_fractional_strength_progress() -> float` - Returns progress toward next level (0.0-1.0)
- Similar functions for speed, vitality, and luck stats

#### Rod Class
- `_gain_strength_from_fish(player, fish)` - Main progression function called on catch

## 🎮 Player Experience Features

"Gained 0.015 strength from catching rare Salmon! (45.2% progress)"
"Strength increased to 5! (12.3% progress toward next level)"
```

### Visual Indicators
