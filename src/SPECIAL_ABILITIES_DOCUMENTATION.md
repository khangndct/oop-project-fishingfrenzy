# Special Abilities Testing and Documentation

## ðŸ”® Special Abilities Implementation Summary

### âœ… **Epic Fish - DASH Ability**
- **Activation**: Randomly every 2-3 seconds when not on cooldown
- **Effect**: Speed increases by 2.5x for 1 second
- **Cooldown**: 3 seconds
- **Escape Chance**: 15% when hooked during dash
- **Visual**: Speed boost visible in movement

### âœ… **Legendary Fish - INVISIBILITY Ability**  
- **Activation**: Randomly every 2-3 seconds when not on cooldown
- **Effect**: 
  - Becomes 70% transparent (alpha = 0.3)
  - Teleports to random screen position
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Cooldown**: 5 seconds  
- **Escape Chance**: 30% when hooked during invisibility
- **Visual**: Semi-transparent fish that teleports

## ðŸŽ® **Movement Patterns Implemented**

### **Common Fish**: Straight
- Simple linear movement

### **Uncommon Fish**: Slight Wave
- Gentle sine wave pattern
- Adds vertical oscillation to movement

### **Rare Fish**: Zigzag
- Sharp directional changes
- Creates unpredictable movement

### **Epic Fish**: Circular
- Spiral/circular movement overlay
- Combines with dash ability

### **Legendary Fish**: Teleport
- Base movement + teleportation ability
- Most unpredictable pattern

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Timer System**
- `ability_timer`: Controls ability duration
- `ability_cooldown_timer`: Controls ability cooldown
- `movement_timer`: Tracks time for movement patterns

### **State Management**
- `is_ability_active`: Prevents multiple ability activations
- `is_ability_on_cooldown`: Manages cooldown periods
- Clean shutdown when fish is caught/deleted

### **Strategy Pattern Integration**
- Each behavior class implements:
  - `apply_special_ability(fish)`: Activates ability
  - `remove_special_ability(fish)`: Cleans up ability
  - `get_ability_cooldown()`: Returns cooldown time
  - `get_ability_duration()`: Returns duration time

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Commands**

### Force activate ability on any fish:
```gdscript
# In Fish class
fish.force_activate_ability()
```

### Check ability status:
```gdscript
print("Has ability: ", fish.fish_data.has_special_ability())
print("Ability: ", fish.fish_data.get_special_ability())
print("Is active: ", fish.is_ability_active)
print("On cooldown: ", fish.is_ability_on_cooldown)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Gameplay Impact**

### **Increased Challenge**
- Rare fish are harder to catch due to abilities
- Players must time their fishing attempts
- Escape mechanics add tension

### **Visual Feedback**
- Console messages show ability usage
- Visual effects (transparency, teleportation)
- Speed changes are noticeable

### **Strategic Elements**
- Players learn fish behavior patterns
- Timing becomes important for rare catches
- Risk/reward balance for valuable fish

## ðŸ”„ **Future Enhancements**

### **Additional Abilities**
- **Freeze**: Temporarily stop all movement
- **Clone**: Create decoy fish
- **Shield**: Temporary immunity to hooks
- **Speed Burst**: Multiple short speed increases

### **Visual Effects**
- Particle systems for ability activation
- Screen shake for powerful abilities
- Color changes during ability use
- Trail effects for fast movement

### **Audio Integration**
- Sound effects for each ability
- Audio cues for ability readiness
- Different sounds per rarity level

The special ability system is now fully functional and integrated with the Strategy Pattern, providing engaging gameplay mechanics while maintaining clean, extensible code architecture.
