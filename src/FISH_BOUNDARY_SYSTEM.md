# Fish Boundary Management System (Vertical Only)

## Overview
This document summarizes the vertical-only boundary handling system implemented for fish movement and special abilities. Fish are constrained to stay within top and bottom screen boundaries but can freely exit through left and right sides to be naturally deleted by the existing cleanup system.

## üéØ Problem Solved
- Fish with various movement patterns were going above or below screen boundaries
- Special abilities like teleportation needed to keep fish visible vertically
- Fish escape mechanics needed vertical safety while allowing horizontal exit
- Natural fish deletion system requires fish to exit horizontally

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Core Boundary Functions

#### `_clamp_to_screen_bounds()`
```gdscript
- Keeps fish within VERTICAL boundaries only (top/bottom)
- Allows fish to exit horizontally (left/right) for natural deletion
- Takes sprite size into account for accurate collision detection
- Default margin: 50px from top and bottom edges only
- Automatically triggers collision handling when vertical boundaries are hit
```

#### `_handle_boundary_collision()`
```gdscript
- Vertical bouncing behavior when fish hit top/bottom edges
- NO horizontal collision handling - fish can exit left/right
- Velocity reversal with randomization for vertical bouncing only
- Automatic steering away from top/bottom boundaries
- Debug logging for vertical boundary collisions only
```

#### `_get_safe_teleport_position()`
```gdscript
- Returns safe positions within full screen bounds (special abilities only)
- Used specifically for teleportation abilities that should keep fish visible
- Larger safety margin (100px) for teleportation effects
```

### 2. Movement Pattern Improvements

#### Vertical Boundary Awareness
- Movement patterns now only check for proximity to top/bottom boundaries
- Fish automatically steer away from vertical edges when near them
- Gentle steering (20% lerp) to maintain natural movement
- NO horizontal boundary checking - fish can freely move left/right

#### Pattern-Specific Enhancements
- **Straight**: Natural horizontal movement with vertical boundary awareness
- **Slight Wave**: Wave motion respects top/bottom limits only
- **Zigzag**: Sharp turns avoid vertical boundaries only
- **Circular**: Spiral patterns stay within vertical safe areas
- **Teleport**: Random teleportation maintains full screen positioning

### 3. Special Ability Safety

#### Invisibility/Teleportation
```gdscript
- Special abilities use full screen bounds for positioning
- Fish.gd safe teleportation keeps abilities exciting and visible
- Teleportation effects maintain game engagement
```

#### Escape Mechanics (Modified)
```gdscript
- Escape direction only validated for vertical boundaries
- Fish can escape horizontally off-screen (natural deletion)
- Vertical escape redirected to safe areas when needed
- Maintains escape effectiveness while allowing natural cleanup
```

### 4. Natural Fish Lifecycle

#### Horizontal Exit Strategy
```gdscript
- Fish naturally swim off left/right sides of screen
- Existing VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D handles cleanup
- No artificial boundaries interfere with natural behavior
- Game's spawn/despawn cycle remains intact
```

### 4. Enhanced Player Interaction

#### Ability Resistance System
```gdscript
- Player stats now affect fish ability activation rates
- Base 5% chance modified by player resistance
- Minimum 1% chance ensures abilities still occur
```

#### Escape Chance Modification
```gdscript
- Player stats influence fish escape success rates
- Minimum 5% escape chance for game balance
- Debug output shows calculated probabilities
```

## üìä Technical Specifications

### Boundary Margins
- **Vertical Movement**: 50px margin from top and bottom edges only
- **Horizontal Movement**: NO boundaries - fish can exit left/right freely
- **Teleportation**: 100px margin for safer positioning (special abilities only)
- **Sprite Awareness**: Accounts for fish sprite dimensions in vertical calculations

### Collision Detection
- Real-time Y-position clamping during movement (no X clamping)
- Vertical velocity adjustment on top/bottom boundary contact
- Randomized bounce factors (0.8x to 1.2x) for vertical bouncing variety
- Horizontal movement unrestricted for natural fish lifecycle

### Debug Features
- Vertical boundary collision logging with fish names and positions
- Teleportation event tracking (for special abilities only)
- Visual notifications for special ability teleport effects
- No horizontal boundary logging (intentionally unrestricted)

- Special abilities remain exciting while keeping fish visible
- Performance optimized with selective boundary checking

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Files Modified
1. **Fish.gd**: Vertical-only boundary system implementation
2. **FishData.gd**: Safe teleportation for special abilities (unchanged)
3. **FISH_BOUNDARY_SYSTEM.md**: Updated documentation

### Dependencies
- `get_viewport_rect()` for screen size detection (vertical calculations only)
- `GlobalVariable.player_ref` for stat-based modifiers (unchanged)
- `VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D` for natural horizontal exit cleanup
- Fish sprite texture data for accurate vertical collision bounds

## üöÄ Design Philosophy

### Natural Fish Behavior
- Fish spawn from left side and naturally swim across screen
- Horizontal movement unrestricted to preserve game flow
- Vertical boundaries prevent fish from disappearing above/below view
- Special abilities (teleportation) keep fish engaged and visible

### Performance Considerations
- Reduced boundary checking (vertical only) improves performance
- Selective collision detection minimizes processing overhead
- Natural cleanup system handles horizontal exits efficiently

## üìù Code Examples

### Vertical-Only Boundary Check
```gdscript
# In _clamp_to_screen_bounds()
# Only clamp Y position (top and bottom) - allow fish to exit left and right
if position.y < min_bounds.y:
    new_position.y = min_bounds.y
    was_clamped = true
elif position.y > max_bounds.y:
    new_position.y = max_bounds.y
    was_clamped = true
# No X clamping - fish can exit horizontally
```

### Vertical Movement Pattern Enhancement
```gdscript
# Check if fish is near vertical boundaries only
var near_vertical_boundary = (position.y < margin or position.y > screen_size.y - margin)
if near_vertical_boundary:
    # Adjust Y direction to avoid top/bottom boundaries
    if position.y < margin:
        direction.y = lerp(direction.y, abs(direction.y), 0.2)  # Steer downward
```

### Smart Escape Mechanics
```gdscript
# Only redirect if escape would go out of vertical bounds
if (projected_position.y < margin or projected_position.y > screen_size.y - margin):
    # Keep horizontal escape but adjust vertical direction
    var safe_y_direction = (center_y - position.y) / abs(center_y - position.y)
    escape_direction.y = safe_y_direction * 0.5
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Dynamic boundary margins based on fish size
- Boundary-specific movement behaviors (wall following)
- Screen edge visual effects for boundary collisions
- Customizable boundary shapes (non-rectangular areas)

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new movement patterns with boundary awareness
- Modular design allows per-fish boundary customization
- Debug system can be expanded for analytics

## üìù Code Examples

### Basic Boundary Check
```gdscript
# In _physics_process()
position += current_velocity
_clamp_to_screen_bounds()  # Automatic boundary enforcement
```

### Safe Teleportation
```gdscript
# For special abilities
var safe_pos = _get_safe_teleport_position()
fish.position = safe_pos
```

### Movement Pattern Enhancement
```gdscript
# Boundary-aware direction adjustment
if near_boundary:
    var center = screen_size * 0.5
    var to_center = (center - position).normalized()
    direction = direction.lerp(to_center, 0.1)
```

## ‚úÖ Quality Assurance

### Testing Scenarios
- Fish movement near all screen edges
- Special ability activation near boundaries
- Escape attempts from various positions
- Long-term gameplay without fish loss

### Validation Metrics
- Zero fish disappearances off-screen
- Natural movement behavior maintained
- Special abilities remain functional and exciting
- Performance impact negligible
