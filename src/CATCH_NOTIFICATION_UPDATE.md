# Fish Notification Update - Catch Only Display

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **Removed Spawn Notifications**
- Fish no longer display their name and rarity when they spawn
- This creates more mystery and surprise when fishing
- Players must catch the fish to discover what they caught

### **Enhanced Catch Notifications**
- **New Format**: `🎣 [Fish Name] [RARITY] CAUGHT!`
- **Longer Display**: Catch notifications now show for 3 seconds (instead of 2)
- **Larger Size**: Increased notification box to 80x20 pixels to fit longer text
- **Blue Background**: Added distinctive blue background for catch notifications
- **Rarity Colors**: Fish name displays in rarity-appropriate color

### **Maintained Other Notifications**
- Special ability notifications still show (⚡ DASH!, 👻 INVISIBLE!, etc.)
- Escape notifications still appear (💨 ESCAPED!)
- Ability status notifications remain (✅ Ready!, ⏰ ended)

## 🎮 **Improved Player Experience**

### **Mystery & Discovery**
- Players no longer know what fish they're approaching
- Catching fish becomes more exciting with the reveal
- Rare fish catches feel more rewarding

### **Clear Feedback**
- When fish is successfully caught, player sees:
  - 🎣 Fishing icon
  - Fish name (e.g., "Dragon Fish")
  - Rarity level (e.g., "LEGENDARY")
  - "CAUGHT!" confirmation
- All in the appropriate rarity color (Gold for Legendary, etc.)

### **Better Visual Impact**
- Catch notifications are more prominent (3-second display)
- Larger notification box accommodates full fish information
- Blue background makes catch notifications distinctive
- Rarity colors make valuable catches immediately recognizable

## 🎯 **Gameplay Benefits**

1. **Increased Suspense**: Players won't know if they're approaching a common or legendary fish
2. **Rewarding Reveals**: Catching a rare fish provides a satisfying "jackpot" moment
3. **Focus on Abilities**: Players will focus on fish behavior (movement patterns, abilities) rather than just targeting by name
4. **Cleaner Visuals**: Fewer notifications on screen during normal gameplay

## 📋 **What Players Will See Now**

### **During Fishing**
- Fish swimming with their movement patterns
- Special ability notifications when fish use abilities (⚡, 👻, etc.)
- Escape notifications if fish get away (💨)

### **When Catching Fish**
- **Example**: `🎣 Dragon Fish LEGENDARY CAUGHT!` (in gold text, blue background, 3-second display)

The update makes fishing more mysterious and rewarding while maintaining all the important gameplay feedback!
